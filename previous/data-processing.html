											<h3>Fraud Detection - using food delivery men's footprint</h3>
											<p>
												In my home country there usually happens some type of syndicate fraud in food delivery systems. To catch this
												fraud deliveries I ,along with my team , implemented some algorithms to detect the fraud orders to avoid the financial
												losses. 
											</p>
											<p>
												This project detects all the fraud orders delivered by the fraud deliveryman based on his footprint-based
												information. The deliverymenâ€™s footprints were stored every minute in azure blob storage. So used python azure
												libraries to collect the dataset and later conducted the other processing and calculations to detect fraud
												orders.

											</p>
											<p>My contribution to the project was retrieving data from Azure Blob Storage and convert them to readable format. Then
												implemneted the necessary calculations and algorithms for detecting fraud. Also built a automated email sending
												service for reporting the fraud order details to the responsible department of Shohoz. All the scripts were
												implemented with Python.</p>
											<p>
												Feel free to review the sample script I have provided for this fraud detection system. However, please note that
												I am unable to share the complete project due to its confidential nature.

											<h3>Data Transfer from MongoDB to MySQL</h3>
											<p>
												Shohoz Pvt. ltd. redesigned their whole food delivery application structure in 2020. For which we had to create
												a data pipeline to transfer data regularly from new data source in MongoDB to MySql (previous data source) which
												helped all the teams inside shohoz to execute their operations as before without any magnificent change to their
												scripts.
												The scripts for this data pipeline were built from scratch using Python.
										
											</p>
										
											<p>
												Feel free to review the sample script I have provided for this data pipeline system. However, please note that
												I am unable to share the complete project due to its confidential nature.

											<h3>Location Name Formatter</h3>
											<p>This script had been developed to modify the wrong names of source and destination locations of Shohoz's online train ticket system. Previously these names were put with manual input. So there had been a lot of spelling mistakes and other issues. To categorize the location names I had to modify out all the wrong location names from more than 1 million dataset. 
												
											</p>
											<p>This function has been developed with Python. By using selenium, the wrong yet almost similiar name from the dataset had been search in Google Map. After that google map showed the correct location name. Later, stored that correct name in our system. </p>
											<p>Feel free to review the script for the location name formatter</p>

											<h3>Fraud Detection - Device Level</h3>
											<p>
												In my home country there usually happens some type of syndicate fraud in food delivery systems. To catch this
												fraud deliveries I ,along with my team , implemented some algorithms to detect the fraud orders to avoid the
												financial
												losses.
											</p>
										
											<p>My contribution was data retrieving from MySql database with python script. Then do data processing and
												calculations to detect frauds. The coding implementation was done with Python. I have implemented some device
												level fraud detection system to detect the users who are using multiple devices
												or multiple accounts using google advertising id. Scripts are not shared
												here due to confidentiality.</p>

											<h3>Earned wage transaction report creation and automation</h3>
											<p>
												This project was developed for Shohoz Pvt.ltd companie's clients who wanted to view reports for the earned wage
												system regularly.
											
												This project get the data about earned wage system and does some calculations. After that it generates an automated
												report for earned wage product and store the report in the desired storage service of shohoz. I used Python language
												for the script. Storage service RestAPI of shohoz has been used to store the reports.

												Feel free to review the sample script I have provided for this earned wage report service. However, please note that
												I am unable to share the complete project due to its confidential nature.

											<h3>Customer Inventory Analysis</h3>
											<p>
												This is a project based on analytical report of customer inventory of Shohoz pvt.ltd. This was developed in python.
												Shohoz had 4 platforms .Such as Food, Bus Ticket, Rides, Health. This project developed to know the details about
												the overlapping users in all platforms and also for the user retention analysis.
											</p>
											<p>
												I did the huge data retrieving from mysql database and processing part. Also implemneted calculations with Python to
												do the analysis.Scripts are not shared
