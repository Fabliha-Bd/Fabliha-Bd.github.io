										<h3>Realtime Haircolor Simulation</h3>
										<p>This is a deep learning based project for realtime hair color simulation. The color can be simulated on any length of
											hair dynamically. Users can tryout different colors in their hair before purchasing a hair color product. Moreover,
											they
											can add multiple colors together to view ombre/ gradient color in their hair.</p>
										<p>The U-Net model along with the MobileNetV3 transfer learning model and custom layers had been used to achieve an
											exact segmentation of hair in images. The model was trained on a dataset of 26,918 images and the Dice coefficient
											was used as the loss function. HSL coloring formula with customized pipelines was implemented to achieve proper
											light and color by considering environmental brightness. It can detect both long hair and short hair for coloring.
											The system allows users to add multiple colors to hair, including color gradients. </p>
										<p>My contribution to the project was processing the dataset, data augmentation , making the hair color look natural by
											modifying the coloring formula algorithm, develop short hair and long hair detection algorithm and divide hair area
											for 2 color mixing with gradient effect.

											<h3>Time Series Forecasting</h3>
											<p>This is a product sale forecasting API to predict the sales of thousands of products. After trying out various
												machine learning and deep learning models, such as -ARIMA, XGBoost, TFT, N-Beats etc. , FBProphet model
												generally
												provided the best outcome for thousands of products. FBProphet seemed more convenient combined with the holiday
												effect. </p>
											<p>My contribution is , I had tried out different models and compare the forecasting results to the actual sales
												report. I have also
												developed a custom greedy-based algorithm
												for predicting product demand. Though it seemed good at first but it could not detect the sudden spikes. The
												FBProphet model
												generally provided the best outcome for
												thousands of products. FBProphet seemed
												more convenient combined with the holiday
												effect.</p>

											<h3>Reverse Image Search</h3>
											<p>This is a product search API for reverse image based search. Used deep learning models for image feature
												selection, such as Resnet50, Xception, DenseNet121, and VGG19. The API can also do text label based search where
												KerasOCR had been used. There is also a barcode scanning feature to capture the image barcode. Several custom
												modifications with background removal techniques were done before the detection of the barcode. </p>
											<p>My contribution to the project was mainly on data processing part, i worked on background removal of images to
												imrpove the accuracy of product detection. Also, i have implemented the textLabeled based search with KerasOCR.

											<h3>Hairstyle Generator</h3>
											<p>This is a project for simulating various popular hairstyle on someone's hair. Used StyleGAN model for this. Tried
												multiple techniques to generate hairstyle. "Style Your Hair" technique seems the best fit till now. This can
												generate hairstyle even with different pose and angles. Work is still going on this project. </p>
											<p>My contribution is trying out Barbershop technique on various sample images for hair style generation and time
												optimization. </p>
